# Expectation
I had expected most challenges in Coding and Testing. 

# Things that went well
Surprisingly coding and testing! I had errors however not to the extent I had expected. 

# Things that didn't go as planned
Creating Git branches didn't go as I had planned and due to that I had to restart my project mid week. The branches are looking bit better than the graph of original project.

# Possible improvements for future revisions of the project
Possible improvements can be offering more find method to users, like finding a book by title, author, availabe status and reserved status. Creating more tables with more reading materials like newspaper and magazines.
