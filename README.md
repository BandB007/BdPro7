# BdPro7

To establish my learning that I have been through for the past 9 weeks via intense bootcamp.

I expect that coding and testing are part of the challenges where I may hit most bumps. I also believe if that happens then that will help me gain a clear understanding of everything I have learned on the project.

For future revision of the project Iâ€™ll read more, watch more videos and keep revisiting certain topics till my doubts are clear and so is the understanding of the topic.

What went well:


What didn't go as planned:
